# express-starter-pack
A script to start an express js project with the essential folders.


# Install

To install this program run in the terminal:

```
npm i -g express-starter-pack
```


# How to use

After the install, you need to create an empty folder. Inside the folder you created, run in the terminal:

```
express-starter-pack
```

It creates the structure of an express project.
The created folders and files are:

```
|-- your-folder
    |-- config
    |-- controllers
    |-- models
    |-- routes
    |-- index.js
    |-- package.json  
```

Also, it installs the express package for you.

Now, you can run your express app using:

```
node index.js
```

You'll see the following output:

```
Listening on port 3000
```

And that's it, now you can modify the structure as you wish.
